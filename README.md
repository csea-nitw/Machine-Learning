#WEEK 4
Have you ever drooled over the idea of how a machine learns from experience? Have you ever thought about the similarities between a human neuron and the artificial neural network? Mind you. They work on the exact same principle!
AI Saturday's is back with another post on Neural Networks and it's applications.

Let's assume a scenario wherein you want to extract complex equations from handwritten notes, pictures or PDFs. Seems like a very difficult task right? Not any more.
Start-up Mathpix launched Snip, a free tool which leverages computer-vision to instantly convert screenshots of complex mathematical equations into editable text (LaTex).
It allows to take pictures of individual equations, paragraphs , handwritten or not , and even full pages of text.
Snip now offers an API , making it even easier to use.

#WEEK 5
Do you want to do something fascinating like Self driving cars,Siri or Alexa? IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where 
intuition plays a key role.Deep Learning can solve such complex problems
 and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.
AI Saturday's is back to introduce  this amazing branch of machine learning
DEEP LEARNING.

#WEEK 6
In today's day and age of instant image sharing, it's essential to get your tech ready to talk the language of images.
This is where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are born.
 Their job is to take a regular image as input and provide a classification output, similar to the processes followed by the human brain.

#WEEK 8
Have you heard Mona Lisa speaking?' Yes! The enigmatic, painted smile of the "Mona Lisa" is known around the world, but that famous face recently displayed a startling new range of expressions, courtesy of artificial intelligence (AI).
AI Saturdays is back to introduce you all an amazing part of AI - GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks).
Using this we can generate photorealistic images, change facial expressions, create computer game scenes, visualize designs, and much more.GANs are an approach to generative modelling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks.
